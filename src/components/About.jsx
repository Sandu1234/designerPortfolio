      <h2>Hello there,<br />I'm Sandamini</h2>
      <p>
      I design bespoke brand identities and websites that fit each company like a well-tailored suit, ensuring your brand stands out digitally and physically. Specialising in brand identity design, Iâ€™m also a web designer and Webflow developer with a keen eye for typography and motion design.</p>

      Outside work, I enjoy photography, travelling, and staying active through running, resistance training, and playing volleyball.      </p>
